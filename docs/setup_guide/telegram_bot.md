# Telegram Bot Setup

This walkthrough will guide you through setting up your Telegram Bot to get messages from `ntfyme`.

But before we start, I will make the below claims for any security related concerns:

1. No form of mailing is done to any other email address other than the one you provide. You will message yourself ONLY.
2. Your chat_id, bot token and any other sensitive information is not shared with any third party.
3. The code is open source and you can verify the code to see that it does not do anything malicious.
4. The code is run on your local machine and does not send any data to any other server.

**NOTE:** The chat_id and bot token are not encrypted for your own convenience. This is because chat_id is a public information and bot token can be changed anytime. However, if you feel the need to encrypt it, please raise an issue on repository and this feature maybe added as optional(currently not planned).

# Let's Start

To setup your Telegram Bot, you will need to create a bot and get the bot token and chat_id. This is a one time setup and you will not have to do this again, unless you are changing your bot.

I am assuming you already have a Telegram account. If not, please create one.
